# Obsidian Brain

A self-extending system for organising Obsidian vaults, for agents and humans working together.

## Quick Start

1. Copy `template-vault/` to your preferred location
2. Copy `src/brain-core/` into the vault as `.brain-core/` (the template vault uses a symlink for development convenience, but real vaults should contain a copy so they're self-contained and portable)
3. Open the folder as an Obsidian vault
4. Enable the CSS snippet in **Settings > Appearance > CSS Snippets** (`folder-colours`)
5. Start working — agents read `CLAUDE.md` → `_Config/router.md` and follow the workflow automatically

To upgrade brain-core later, replace the contents of `.brain-core/` with the new version from `src/brain-core/`.

## How It Works

All content in the vault is an **artefact** — either **living** (evolves over time, current version is truth) or **temporal** (bound to a moment, written once). System folders (`_Attachments/`, `_Config/`, `_Plugins/`, `.obsidian/`) are infrastructure, not artefacts. Living artefacts sit at the vault root; temporal artefacts sit under `_Temporal/`.

The **router** (`_Config/router.md`) is the single file agents read every session. It lists which artefact types exist, workflow triggers to follow, and links to configuration. **Taxonomy** files (`_Config/Taxonomy/`) describe each artefact type in detail — agents read only the types they need.

## Core / Config Split

- **`.brain-core/`** — versioned methodology. How the Brain system works. Copied into each vault during setup and upgrades (not symlinked), so vaults are self-contained.
- **`_Config/`** — instance configuration. Router, taxonomy, style, colours. Specific to this vault.

## Plugins

The `_Plugins/` folder holds data managed by external tools. Each tool installs its own subfolder, skill doc, and MCP config. See the [plugin guide](docs/plugins.md) for how to install or write plugins.

Available plugins:

- [Undertask](https://github.com/Rob-Morris/undertask/tree/main/plugins/obsidian-brain) — task management via MCP tools

## Customisation

- **`Agents.md`**: add your name and personal context for agents
- **`_Config/router.md`**: add/remove artefact types and workflow triggers
- **`_Config/Taxonomy/`**: add taxonomy files for new artefact types
- **`_Config/Styles/writing.md`**: adjust language preferences (defaults to Australian English)
- **`_Config/router.md` § Principles**: vault-level constraints
- **`_Config/Styles/obsidian.md`**: folder colours and file explorer styling
